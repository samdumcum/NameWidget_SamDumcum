Files included:

namewidget.php - PHP code for widget with notes
namewidgetstyle.css - Styling for PHP name widget
header.php - Theme header file containing link to .css

Notes:

Web Address - 
linking to 'About Us' page as the home page is unique 
and does not show widgets

Styling - 
Based on "Little Mermaid" theme created for document machine
Colors and fonts consistent with site
no hard borders because we don't have those anywhere
rounded corners to feel the waves

Widget - 
Wasn't sure if we were allowed to change the names of fields
so I changed the descriptions (to keep with website theme)

Adventures of the Sea leaves page on scroll, but
Name Widget always stays on screen
